    "  \n",
    "Welcome to the workshop! Today you're going to learn several techniques related to the processing of geospatial data. We're going to use as background motivation the Kaggle dataset on [Prediction of Taxis Fares](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction) but our main goal is for you to learn the concepts and techniques on how to process such kind of datasets. We'll iteratively build models with higher level features and go through the concepts oh what do they mean and how were they created. At the end, we're going to check one more advanced example on how we can make use of mobility data in order to calculate and incorporate traffic information to your feature engineering processes. This is the overview:\n",

    "\n",
    "The challenge of this dataset is the predict the final fare paid by user by just having a small set of variables to work with:\n",
    "* **pickup_datetime**: Time that a user was picked-up by a taxi\n",
    "* **pickup_latitude**:   pickup location\n",
    "* **pickup_longitude**:  pickup location\n",
    "* **dropoff_latitude**:  drop-off location\n",
    "* **dropoff_longitude**: drop-off location   \n",
    "* **passenger_count**: amount of passengers in this trip\n",
    "  \n",
    "This creates a few challenges, as we don't exactly know the route that the driver took. This means that any fixed taxes or tolls are not explicited coded as variables, so we'll see a few ways to try to identify these hidden features.  \n",

It's originally created in React, but you can upload csv's directly to their [application website](https://kepler.gl/) and now also in Python with the [Jupyter extension](https://medium.com/vis-gl/introducing-kepler-gl-for-jupyter-f72d41659fbf).  \n",

    "* **Line**: Origin-Destination line, drawing a line from point A to point B. It needs 2 pairs of columns `lat`/`lon`\n",
    "* **Arc**: Same as line but lines are curved that puts longer distances in evidence.\n",
    "* **Heatmap**: Aggregate close by `Points` in a way that, in places where more points are together, the more the heatmap's color change\n",
    "* **Grid**: Similar to heatmaps, but aggregate data in quadratic polygons\n",
    "* **HexBin**: Similar to heatmaps, but aggregate data in hexagonal polygons\n",
    "* **Polygon**: Custom geometries defined in your dataset. Can be constructed by using [GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) + [GeoJSON](https://macwright.org/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite.html) structures. You can check some examples [here](https://github.com/keplergl/kepler.gl/blob/master/bindings/kepler.gl-jupyter/notebooks/GeoDataFrame.ipynb) but it's not in the scope of this workshop. However, feel free to approach and ask us :)\n",

    "* **H3**: Visualize data based on H3 indexes `hex_id` column. We're going to look at H3 in the next section.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/traffic.png\" width=\"500\"> \n",
    "<center>Traffic information from Google Maps</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've learned already, OSRM works over partitioning OSM's data into a routable graph. OSRM works great if you want the **shortest** route, *i.e.*, find the minimum path between two nodes where the edge weight is the street length. However, if you want to consider more realistic scenarios, OSRM provide you with tools to route the **fastest** route between two nodes, *i.e.*, incorporate your own traffic data inside the router so it takes this information into consideration ([Reference](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Traffic)). Before we dig into the traffic data incorporation, lets first take a look at how OSM maps data internally:  \n",
    "\n",
    "## OSM Data Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nodes, Ways and Relations  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/osm_data_types_.jpg\" width=\"500\"> \n",
    "<center>Data types in OSM</center>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Everything that is inside OSM is represent by one of three possible geometries ([Reference](https://labs.mapbox.com/mapping/osm-data-model/)):\n",
    "* **Node** - A node is everything that can be represented by a point, a unique object with no large spatial dimensions, such as a POIs or objects, such as this lamp post: https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/6343276469  \n",
    "* **Way** - A way is a line connecting two or more nodes. In this workshop's use case, ways are mainly streets connecting two nodes, *i.e.*, street intersections. Example: https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/4402228\n",
    "* **Relations** - As the name says, relations are used to create higher level structures that contains nodes and ways inside it. Example: https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1685018  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tags\n",
    "  \n",
    "Tags are the metadata of each data type defined above. All data types contains a set of possible (but not mandatory) tags related to the tags' semantics. For instance, if you look at the left side of the screen in any of the data types examples above, you'll see that:  \n",
    "* **Nodes** have a description of what exactly is the node. Implicitly, **all** OSM nodes also have a `latitude/longitude` associated with it.\n",
    "* Street **Ways** have informations about the street, such as whether it has a `bicycle path`, if it has a `sidewalk` and mainly, what is it's `maximum driving speed`. An important observation on ways is that **it doesn't always have maximum speed**. Ways in OSM were not created having routing in mind so that ways can be defined split in multiple pieces or a same path can be inside different ways. See for example https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/7552152 and https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/48859717. Street ways can also be complex because we might not have the same street speed during the whole \n",
    "* An important feature about **Relations** is their [administrative level](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:admin%20level?uselang=en-GB). This level indicates the level of hierarchy that this relation is taking in terms of spatial boundary. Small administrative levels indicate small spaces, such as parks and neighbors while higher administrative levels go to cities/countries/continents.\n",
    "  \n",
    "## Traffic Proof of Concept (POC)\n",
    "\n",
    "OSRM allows you to define what is the street speed by allowing you to provide an external CSV file that sets it. For that, you need to define the speeds segment by segment, *i.e.*, by each pair of sequential node ids, you can set what is the street speed at that point ([Reference](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Traffic)).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Lets learn how to use for a simple example. \n",
    "1. When we call the router we used in the sections above, it also returns the sequence of node ids that compose the route in OSM. \n",
    "2.  We take the same example of pick up and drop off as above, but then we're going to set all street speeds between those segments to 1 (km/h).  \n",
    "3. We're then going to set up the router with the new \"traffic\" information and see what happens\n",
    "  \n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> \n",
    "<b>Be careful</b>: Do <b>not</b> set the speeds to 0, as it breaks the router by unkown reasons, until now.    \n",
    "</div>\n"

    "Newson and Krumm created an approach that takes into account the whole sequence of nodes and then try to match them in a probabilistic way. The way they do this is by using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), where the states are each of the nodes presented in the map and the observation sequences are the GPS location sequences. \n",

    "  \n",
    "Main parameters to be understood here are:  \n",
    "* **geometries**: set of latitudes and longitudes that will be matched to the street.\n",
    "* **timestamps**: set of **unix timestamps** where `len(timestamps) == len(geometries)`. Timestamps can be used as an additional information when matching points. The bigger the difference between two timestamps from two sequential GPS points are, the more loose we can be when matching them to the street.\n",
    "* **radiuses**: set of **integers** where `len(radiuses) == len(geometries)`. When GPS points are obtained from sensors or, mainly, smartphones, each point comes with an accuracy measure associated with it. The number represents the uncertainty radius around each point, where the true position could be in any place inside the circle. The bigger the uncertainty, the more loose the points can be matched to the street, of course, also increasing the chances of a false matching.  \n",

    "The main source of information in the mobility context is [Floating Car Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_car_data). Nowadays, no one walk without a smartphone. These devices can locate their own position and send to appropriate services through a mobile internet connection. As the data arrive to the servers, they can be used in two ways to calculate traffic information:\n",
    "* **Real time**: As soon as the data arrive, it can be binned/aggregated for a specific time window, *e.g.*, 10 minutes, and then used the extracted measures to update a traffic router.\n",
    "* **Historical aggregates**: The influx of data can be stored for a longer time and we can process it in order to extract average traffic patterns over a certain period of time. For example, we could aggregate 1 month of data into 1 week of usual behavior and use this as traffic features for your router.  \n",

In this traffic section we're working with a mock of GPS signals, made by OSRM itself to build routes from A to B. The objective of this part then is not to analyze data or summaries statistics, but to understand possible techniques on how to embed traffic information into your OSRM.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of creating traffic data from historical aggregates is to bin your historic data into bins and then summarize the average metric present in multiple days into an average metric. The main source usually used is <b>speed</b>. However, in this mock data, as we don't have access to GPS speed information, we will use <i>count</i> as a proxy to traffic measures.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "Lets start with a set of GPS routes, pretending that they're our GPS set obtained by yourself or from a third-party company. After applying map-matching to then, we then end up with a list of node ids, as the [previous section](#Snap-noisy-GPS-points-to-street-using-map-matching) showed. For this example, I'll bin the samples in a hourly basis, but this kind be defined depending in your use case."
