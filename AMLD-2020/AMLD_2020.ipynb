    "  \n",
    "Welcome to the workshop! Today you're going to learn several techniques related to the processing of geospatial data. We're going to use as background motivation the Kaggle dataset on [Prediction of Taxis Fares](https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction) but our main goal is for you to learn the concepts and techniques on how to process such kind of datasets. We'll iteratively build models with higher level features and go through the concepts oh what do they mean and how were they created. At the end, we're going to check one more advanced example on how we can make use of mobility data in order to calculate and incorporate traffic information to your feature engineering processes. This is the overview:\n",

    "<center>Kaggle Taxi Prediction Homepage Picture</center>  \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge of this dataset is the predict the final fare paid by user by just having a small set of variables to work with:\n",
    "* **pickup_datetime**: Time that a user was picked-up by a taxi\n",
    "* **pickup_latitude**:   pickup location\n",
    "* **pickup_longitude**:  pickup location\n",
    "* **dropoff_latitude**:  drop-off location\n",
    "* **dropoff_longitude**: drop-off location   \n",
    "* **passenger_count**: amount of passengers in this trip\n",
    "  \n",
    "This creates a few challenges, as we don't exactly know the route that the driver took. This means that any fixed taxes or tolls are not explicited coded as variables, so we'll see a few ways to try to identify these hidden features.  \n",

    "* **Line**: Origin-Destination line, drawing a line from point A to point B. It needs 2 pairs of columns `lat`/`lon`\n",
    "* **Arc**: Same as line but lines are curved that puts longer distances in evidence.\n",
    "* **Heatmap**: Aggregate close by `Points` in a way that, in places where more points are together, the more the heatmap's color change\n",
    "* **Grid**: Similar to heatmaps, but aggregate data in quadratic polygons\n",
    "* **HexBin**: Similar to heatmaps, but aggregate data in hexagonal polygons\n",
    "* **Polygon**: Custom geometries defined in your dataset. Can be constructed by using [GeoPandas](http://geopandas.org/) + [GeoJSON](https://macwright.org/2015/03/23/geojson-second-bite.html) structures. You can check some examples [here](https://github.com/keplergl/kepler.gl/blob/master/bindings/kepler.gl-jupyter/notebooks/GeoDataFrame.ipynb) but it's not in the scope of this workshop. However, feel free to approach and ask us :)\n",

    "* **H3**: Visualize data based on H3 indexes `hex_id` column. We're going to look at H3 in the next section.\n",

    "Although it works for our model, if you look at pipeline1's output, the euclidean distance values don't make any sense. The linear model manages to compensate the non sense values to the output by adjusting it's weights. However, if we need to explain our model's decision, it's good to have the features into some unit of measure, whether spacial or standardized, for example. Which makes us wonder, so then, `What is Latitude/Longitude?`\n",

    "UTM is a projection that, as other projection types, maps the spherical earth to a flat surface. However, UTM performs this operation to a set of subgrids. \n",
    "* This has the advantage of not having long distortions in the poles or in the equator, such as Mercator's or Robinson's projections. **When calculating distances from the same sub grid** \n",
    "* Suffer the same distortion effects when projecting features that encompass multiple grids or distances from far away objects  \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, for localized distances between elements, *i.e.*, elements that fall over the same grid, [UTM is a good projection system](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-enterprise/mapping/measuring-distances-and-areas-when-your-map-uses-the-mercator-projection/). In our distance calculations, UTM is a good choice, because their projections are calculated on `meters` unit.\n",
    "  \n",
    "UTM projects the latitude and longitude to a [three numbers representation][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Transverse_Mercator_coordinate_system#Locating_a_position_using_UTM_coordinates]:\n",
    "* **Zone** - Zone is a number attributed to every grid as in the picture above. We can use online tools to figure out the UTM zone of a region\n",
    "* **Easting** - For every grid, their central meridian starts with a value of 500.000 and the *easting* value represents how many `meters` east is the point to this grid's meridian\n",
    "* **Northing** - For every grid, this value represents how far away the point is from the south pole `in meters`\n",

    "<center>Blue line representing straight line distance between points A and B while real route distance is displayed by Google Maps. Source: <a href=\"https://shorturl.at/cqz37\">Google Maps</a></center>  \n",
    "\n",
    "All the distances seen by now are straight line distances, *i.e.* the minimal distance that connects the two points. However, in a city, we can only walk, drive or cycle through streets and sidewalks. Take a look at the picture above. Even though the origin and destination are in a certain distance, we can't go through the river with our cars (theoretically). Routers such as google maps have the city street layout with them and so they can calculate routes by different means of transportation. A open source tool works over [Open Street Maps](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) (OSM) and can calculate these routes for us. For testing their API, they make a [demo](https://map.project-osrm.org/) and a [public server](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Demo-server) available, but in both you're limited to a limited amount of requests, in order not to overload them.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "If we want to freely use the router's features, we can deploy one OSRM's instance in our machine or in your own servers. Next, we're going to see how we do it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can setup OSRM by two ways:\n",
    "* Use a standard pre-created dockerfile - [Source](https://hub.docker.com/r/osrm/osrm-backend/)\n",
    "* Compile from source - [Source](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend#building-from-source)\n",
    "\n",
    "OSRM works with many configuration files, such as transportation profiles, which configure streets max speeds and allowed paths. The standard configuration works really well for almost all simple cases and the dockerfiles are way simpler to set up. However, if you want to adapt any of these files, you'd have to download and compile the source code with the custom preferences changed. Here, we're going to see how to set up using dockerfiles:\n",
    "\n",
    "While setting up this workshop project (with `make`) we've already set up a functional OSRM for you and you can go to next cells to test it out :)  \n",
    "However, for the learning process, we can do it locally with the instructions below, which, by the way, are the same commands that the `makefile` is doing in `make setup`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions:   \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">     \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Open a terminal and go to your project folder, create a <i>router</i> folder for cleanliness\n",
    "\n",
    "* wget http://download.geofabrik.de/north-america/us/new-york-latest.osm.pbf (file is ~200 Mb)\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the terminal, move to the folder where the file above was put and execute the following commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* docker run -t -v \"${PWD}:/data\" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-extract -p /opt/car.lua /data/new-york-latest.osm.pbf\n",
    "\n",
    "* docker run -t -v \"${PWD}:/data\" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-partition /data/new-york-latest.osm.pbf\n",
    "\n",
    "* docker run -t -v \"${PWD}:/data\" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-customize /data/new-york-latest.osm.pbf\n",
    "\n",
    "* docker run -t -i -p 5000:5000 -v \"${PWD}:/data\" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-routed --algorithm mld /data/new-york-latest.osm.pbf  \n",
    "     \n",
    "</div>    \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you have the router running in a dedicated process. In order to test it, open another tab in the terminal and type the following:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Test: `curl \"http://localhost:5000/route/v1/driving/-73.996070,40.732605;-73.980675,40.761864?steps=false&geometries=geojson&annotations=true&overview=full\"`  \n",
    " \n",

    "\n",
    "## Calculate street distances and durations  \n",
    "\n",
    "For our pipelines, we're going to use the custom class `utils.OSRMFramework.OSRMFramework` to request and retrieve route data from a OSRM instance. When building the class, you have to send the instance's URL. When it's set up locally with docker, the address is `localhost:5000`. After it, you can use `OSRMFramework.route` sending the pick-up and dropoff's latitudes and longitudes and obtain back 5 types of data:  \n",
    "1 - and 2. - Latitude and longitudes that compose the route   \n",
    "3 - Estimated route distance  \n",
    "4 - Estimated route duration  \n",
    "5 - OSM Node ids. These will be explained in the [Traffic Prototype](#Traffic-Prototype) section.  "

    "<center>Example of spatial indexes. Source: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_95bSEqMzUA\">Youtube: Alexander Müller - Spatial Range Queries Using Python In-Memory Indices</a></center>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional databases have indexes in their system that makes it possible to quickly **find** an element. However, when we are working with elements that have a **spatial relationship**, these indexes don't help us to perform common operations that are frequently performed with spatial data, *i.e.*, with lines and polygons besides points:  \n",
    "* Find K neighboors for every point\n",
    "* Check if points are inside a table of polygons - [spatial joins](http://geopandas.org/mergingdata.html)\n",
    "* Check if lines/polygons intersect and extract their joined/intersected area  \n",
    "\n",
    "Common GIS databases, such as [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/) already have optimizations for this kind of operations. However, how can we create the same features with Python?  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Spatial Indexes**:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "If you look at the [KNNRegressor's documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor.html), you'll see that they have a parameter `algorithm` which is used to find the nearest neighbor. These algorithms, or indexes, maintain a data structure that holds information about the object's proximity. A well established python implementation of spatial index is a `R-Tree` and [Reference 1](http://toblerity.org/rtree/) and [Reference 2](https://geoffboeing.com/2016/10/r-tree-spatial-index-python/) show a bit how do they work and could you implement for your spatial queries:  \n",

    "<img src=\"images/r_tree.png\" width=\"600\"> \n",
    "<center>Insert process of a R-Tree</center>  \n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a set of geometries. We can merge these data points into 2 (or more) separated `bounding boxes` based on a specific heuristic. At the next step, you can interpret that each of the new bounding boxes are themselves a polygon. We can then apply the same heuristics to merge the polygons into higher level bounding boxes and repeat the process until we have just 1 level, the tree root, which is a bounding box that contains all other bounding boxes.  There you go, you have your R(Rectangle)-Tree!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/r_tree_2.png\" width=\"600\"> \n",
    "<center>Built R-Tree</center>  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Because the way the algorithm was build, the **search** process has spatial operations embedded into its functionality. Suppose you want to find the nearest neighbors of your point (or line or polygon). In a traditional approach you would:\n",
    "* Calculate the distance from the geometry A to all other geometries\n",
    "* Sort in increasing order\n",
    "* Choose the K closest neighbors   \n",
    " \n",
    "When you have millions of points, these steps are quite heavy processing. With the R-Tree indexed dataset:   \n",
    "  \n",
    "* From the tree structure, find which bounding box your geometry is:\n",
    "* Retrieve all geometries from inside the leaf node (or from neighbors leaf nodes bounding boxes as well)\n",
    "* Calculate distances, sort and select K closest  \n",
    "\n",
    "The R-Tree helps with filtering out the majority of the dataset that lives outside of the point's bounding box. After the big filtering is done, all the other calculations follow in the same way.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "[Here](https://geoffboeing.com/2016/10/r-tree-spatial-index-python/) is an example that filter streets based on a city polygon using R-Trees.\n",

    "Lets say we wanted to check which routes intersect with a route of interest that we manually selected. [Geopandas](http://geopandas.org/) can perform [spatial joins](https://medium.com/@bobhaffner/spatial-joins-in-geopandas-c5e916a763f3) in order to join tables [based on the relationship types between two geometry columns](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/latest/manual.html#binary-predicates). Here, we use the `intersects` operation in GeoPandas to check whether two linestrings intersect each other. However, the operation is unfortunately still [done element per element](https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2017/09/21/accelerating-geopandas-1). With the R-Tree, we still do element by element search, but we can firstly subselect close-by elements and then perform `intersects` with a small subset of the total dataset. With bigger datasets, this difference in approaches can lead to big differences in performance, as we can see in the example below:"

    "## OSM Data Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nodes, Ways and Relations  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/osm_data_types_.jpg\" width=\"500\"> \n",

    "\n",
    "Everything that is inside OSM is represent by one of three possible geometries ([Reference](https://labs.mapbox.com/mapping/osm-data-model/)):\n",
    "* **Node** - A node is everything that can be represented by a point, a unique object with no large spatial dimensions, such as a POIs or objects, such as this lamp post: https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/6343276469  \n",
    "* **Way** - A way is a line connecting two or more nodes. In this workshop's use case, ways are mainly streets connecting two nodes, *i.e.*, street intersections. Example: https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/4402228\n",
    "* **Relations** - As the name says, relations are used to create higher level structures that contains nodes and ways inside it. Example: https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/1685018  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tags\n",
    "  \n",
    "Tags are the metadata of each data type defined above. All data types contains a set of possible (but not mandatory) tags related to the tags' semantics. For instance, if you look at the left side of the screen in any of the data types examples above, you'll see that:  \n",
    "* **Nodes** have a description of what exactly is the node. Implicitly, **all** OSM nodes also have a `latitude/longitude` associated with it.\n",
    "* Street **Ways** have informations about the street, such as whether it has a `bicycle path`, if it has a `sidewalk` and mainly, what is it's `maximum driving speed`. An important observation on ways is that **it doesn't always have maximum speed**. Ways in OSM were not created having routing in mind so that ways can be defined split in multiple pieces or a same path can be inside different ways. See for example https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/7552152 and https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/48859717. Street ways can also be complex because we might not have the same street speed during the whole \n",
    "* An important feature about **Relations** is their [administrative level](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:admin%20level?uselang=en-GB). This level indicates the level of hierarchy that this relation is taking in terms of spatial boundary. Small administrative levels indicate small spaces, such as parks and neighbors while higher administrative levels go to cities/countries/continents."

    "As you've learned already, OSRM works over partitioning OSM's data into a routable graph. OSRM works great if you want the **shortest** route, *i.e.*, find the minimum path between two nodes where the edge weight is the street length. However, if you want to consider more realistic scenarios, OSRM provide you with tools to route the **fastest** route between two nodes, *i.e.*, incorporate your own traffic data inside the router so it takes this information into consideration ([Reference](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Traffic)). \n",
    "  \n",
    "## Traffic Proof of Concept (POC)\n",
    "\n",
    "OSRM allows you to define what is the street speed by allowing you to provide an external CSV file that sets it. For that, you need to define the speeds segment by segment, *i.e.*, by each pair of sequential node ids, you can set what is the street speed at that point ([Reference](https://github.com/Project-OSRM/osrm-backend/wiki/Traffic)).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "Lets learn how to use for a simple example. \n",
    "1. When we call the router we used in the sections above, it also returns the sequence of node ids that compose the route in OSM. \n",

    "Newson and Krumm created an approach that takes into account the whole sequence of nodes and then try to match them in a probabilistic way. The way they do this is by using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM), where the states are each of the nodes presented in the map and the observation sequences are the GPS location sequences. \n",

    "  \n",
    "Main parameters to be understood here are:  \n",
    "* **geometries**: set of latitudes and longitudes that will be matched to the street.\n",
    "* **timestamps**: set of **unix timestamps** where `len(timestamps) == len(geometries)`. Timestamps can be used as an additional information when matching points. The bigger the difference between two timestamps from two sequential GPS points are, the more loose we can be when matching them to the street.\n",
    "* **radiuses**: set of **integers** where `len(radiuses) == len(geometries)`. When GPS points are obtained from sensors or, mainly, smartphones, each point comes with an accuracy measure associated with it. The number represents the uncertainty radius around each point, where the true position could be in any place inside the circle. The bigger the uncertainty, the more loose the points can be matched to the street, of course, also increasing the chances of a false matching.  \n",

    "The main source of information in the mobility context is [Floating Car Data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_car_data). Nowadays, no one walk without a smartphone. These devices can locate their own position and send to appropriate services through a mobile internet connection. As the data arrive to the servers, they can be used in two ways to calculate traffic information:\n",
    "* **Real time**: As soon as the data arrive, it can be binned/aggregated for a specific time window, *e.g.*, 10 minutes, and then used the extracted measures to update a traffic router.\n",
    "* **Historical aggregates**: The influx of data can be stored for a longer time and we can process it in order to extract average traffic patterns over a certain period of time. For example, we could aggregate 1 month of data into 1 week of usual behavior and use this as traffic features for your router.  \n",

In this traffic section we're working with a mock of GPS signals, made by OSRM itself to build routes from A to B. The objective of this part then is not to analyze data or summaries statistics, but to understand possible techniques on how to embed traffic information into your OSRM.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of creating traffic data from historical aggregates is to bin your historic data into bins and then summarize the average metric present in multiple days into an average metric. The main source usually used is <b>speed</b>. However, in this mock data, as we don't have access to GPS speed information, we will use <i>count</i> as a proxy to traffic measures.   \n",
    "  \n",
    "Lets start with a set of GPS routes, pretending that they're our GPS set obtained by yourself or from a third-party company. After applying map-matching to then, we then end up with a list of node ids, as the [previous section](#Snap-noisy-GPS-points-to-street-using-map-matching) showed. For this example, I'll bin the samples in a hourly basis, but this kind be defined depending in your use case."
